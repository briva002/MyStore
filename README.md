##Summary
MyStore is a website that is set up as demo clothing store. It is used for automation testing. There are many features to be tested on this site such as add items to cart, log into account, sign up for newsletter, search for clothing item, fill out a contact us page message and user can view order history.

##Setup
I setup my project by picking a website to do automation testing on. I set up a repository on git hub and then cloned it into my computer. I opened VS code and set up all the neccessary files in order to make my tests run correctly. This includes nodes, jsons and jest. I then came up with a test plan to test different functionailty of the website.

##what do I test
I tested different functions such as logging into account,signing up for a newsletter, search for items, adding items to cart, view order history and that a user can fill out the contact us page.

##how do I test
I tested the functionailty by both manual and automated testing

##Page Objects
